  "comment:+comment-1751875005817:content": "If you do not wish to modify the following fields, simply keep their original values.\n\n- `max_chunk_tokens`: When translating in segments, this limits the maximum number of tokens per segment. Due to the nature of LLMs, it is impossible to input an entire book into a large language model for translation at once. Therefore, the book will be divided into segments and submitted to the LLM. This parameter is used to limit the maximum length of each segment (measured in tokens).\n- `threads`: The number of concurrent translation requests. If you feel the translation is too slow, you can increase this value. However, it is recommended not to exceed 16 concurrent threads, as this may trigger rate limiting by the LLM provider.\n- `retry_times`: The number of consecutive failures for the same segment before declaring it a failure.\n- `retry_interval_seconds`: The number of seconds to wait before retrying after a failed attempt.",
